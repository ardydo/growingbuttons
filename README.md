You can rate it [HERE](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=56753)

## Initial Concept
* Placeholder name that actually went to be the actual name: Growing Pains
* I'll use both themes.
* You control a growing collum and need to get as high as you can without falling out of the screen.
* One button makes you grow up and the other makes you reverse growth.
* Random enemies spawn and they take you down when you get hit.

## CONTROLS
* Z to grow up
* X to grow (?) down
* ZX to quickly drop!
