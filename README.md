# growingbuttons
entry for ld34

the theme is growing and/or two buttons control

## General Concept
* Placeholder name: Growing Pains
* I'll use both themes.
* You control a growing collum and need to get as high as you can without falling out of the screen.
* One button makes you grow up and the other makes you reverse growth.
* Random enemies spawn and they take you down when you get hit.
